## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/msali7-photo-editor.git
    cd msali7-photo-editor
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application loads the Gemini API key from `process.env.API_KEY`. To provide this, you should create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory:
    
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key. The included `.gitignore` file will prevent this file from being committed to your repository.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a client-side application without a build step, you can run it using any simple local web server. One of the easiest ways is with the [Live Server extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

    Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in server:
    
    - **Python 3:**
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```
    
    Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to the provided local address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
